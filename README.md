## API Server Application

The web application consists of a backend written in C# using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core, and the MVC framework.

In a time when more and more companies are moving towards a remote work environment, they need new ways to organize. This application makes it easier for small businesses to switch to all remote office operations, as people move towards unconventional work times.

VROOM offers companies the ability to coordinate personnel flexible schedules more easily as well as keep an inventory on equipment that gets borrowed. 
Users with admin permissions will be able to keeps track of employees schedules and what office equipment they have at home. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete items from Equipment, Schedule and Employee tables.
