                <p>I am a Redmond, WA-based programmer with a background in Classical Piano. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, gaming and fitness. Having a background as a pianist has given me a lot of experience working under high stress environments while delivering a professional result, and I think that directly applies to the world of software development as well. As a Web Developer I look forward to building beautiful websites that will lead us into the future.</p>

                <p>Coming from the world of online video and ad tech, my background is in managing client relations. I’ve always loved creating and building new things and coding is a fun new way to do it. Outside of work I enjoy watching movies, cooking, gardening, and exploring the beautiful PNW.</p>

                <a href="https://github.com/paulmrest" target="_blank" class="github">GitHub</a>
                <p>I’m Paul. After years of wanting to do a coding bootcamp and it just never fitting in with life and work, I finally found the opportunity in April 2020, and took on Code Fellow’s full-time program. I am primarily interested in becoming a back-end developer, although along the way I am learning a great deal about full stack development. I have been programming to one degree or another since 2011, going so far as to build an iOS app in 2015. I have extensive customer facing experience, including in tech, and am excellent at mediating between what is possible with current technology and client expectations.</p>
